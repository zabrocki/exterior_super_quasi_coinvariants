\section{Introduction}

\section{Quasisymmetric invariants on the exterior algebra}

Fix $n$ a positive integer and
let $R_n = {\mathbb Q}[\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n]$ be the
polynomial ring in anticommuting variables.
The ring $R_n$ is isomorphic to the exterior algebra of a vector
space of dimension $n$.  The variables of this ring satisfy the relations
\[
\theta_i \theta_j = - \theta_j \theta_i \hbox{ if } 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n
\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad \theta_i^2 = 0 \hbox{ for }1 \leq i \leq n~.
\]
Since these conditions impose that a monomial in $R_n$ has no repeated variables,
the monomials are in bijection with subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$
and the dimension of $R_n$ is therefore equal to $2^n$.

Denote $[n] := \{1,2, \ldots,n\}$ and
let $A = \{a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_r \} \subseteq [n]$.
We define $\theta_A := \theta_{a_1} \theta_{a_2} \cdots \theta_{a_r}$,
then the set $\{ \theta_A \}_{A \subseteq [n]}$ is a basis of $R_n$.

We define an action on monomials of $R_n$ and extend this action linearly.
For each integer $1 \leq i < n$, let $\pi_i$ be an operator on $R_n$
that is defined by
\[
\pi_i(\theta_A) = \begin{cases}
\theta_{A} & \hbox{ if } i, i+1 \in A\hbox{ or }i, i+1 \notin A\\
\theta_{A \cup \{i+1\} \backslash \{i\}} & \hbox{ if } i\in A\hbox{ and }i+1 \notin A\\
\theta_{A \cup \{i\} \backslash \{i+1\}} & \hbox{ if } i+1\in A\hbox{ and }i \notin A
\end{cases}~.
\]
These operators instead of exchanging an $i$ for an $i+1$ like the symmetric group
action, have the effect of shifting the indices of the variables (if possible).  They
are therefore known as quasisymmetric operators.  They were studied in depth by
Hivert \cite{H}.  The operators are not multiplicative on $R_n$ in general since, for example,
\[
\pi_1( \theta_{1} \theta_{2})
= \theta_1 \theta_2
= - \pi_1( \theta_{1}) \pi_1(\theta_{2})~.
\]
They are also not multiplicative when they act on the polynomial ring
in commuting variables.

A polynomial that is invariant under the action of quasisymmetric operators
is said to be quasisymmetric invariant (or just `quasisymmetric').
The quasisymmetric invariants of $R_n$ are
linearly spanned by the elements:
\[
F_{1^r}(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n) := \sum_{\substack{A \subseteq [n]\\|A|=r}} \theta_A~.
\]
The notation $F_{1^r}$ for the elements borrow the notation from the
polynomial ring in commuting variable invariants known as the `fundamental
quasisymmetric polynomials'.  The commuting polynomial quasisymmetric
invariants are indexed by compositions.

\subsection{The ideal generated by the quasisymmetric invariants}

Define an ideal of $R_n$ generated by the quasisymmetric invariants as
\[
I_n := \left< F_{1^r}(\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n) : 1 \leq r \leq n \right>
\]

\begin{remark}
Note that since the operators $\pi_i$ are not multiplicative, it
is unlikely to be the case that $I_n$ as an ideal is invariant
under the action of the $\pi_i$.  Indeed, we find that for $n=4$,
\[
\theta_2 F_{1}(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4) =
-\theta_1 \theta_2 + \theta_2 \theta_3 + \theta_2 \theta_4
\]
and if we apply $\pi_1$ to this element, we obtain
\[
\pi_1(\theta_2 F_{1}(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)) =
-\theta_1 \theta_2 + \theta_1 \theta_3 + \theta_1 \theta_4
\]
and this can be shown to not be in $I_4$.
\end{remark}

The \emph{exterior quasisymmetric coinvariants} are defined to be
\mike{I hesitated to give a three letter abbreviated name, like EQC,
but I don't know a better way to
capture the `anti-commuting' and the `quasisymmetric' and the
`coinvariants' in just two letters}
\nantel{and is it really coinvariant? (since the ideal is not invariant)}
\[
EQC_n := R_n/I_n
\]

\subsection{Differential operators on the exerior algebra}
We can define a set of differential operators on $R_n$ which
will permit us to define the orthogonal complement to the
ideal and a notion of quasisymmetric harmonics.

The operators $\partial_{\theta_i}$ act on monomials in $R_n$
by
\[
\partial_{\theta_i}( \theta_A ) = \begin{cases}
(-1)^{\#\{ j \in A: j<i\}}\theta_{A \backslash \{i\}}&\hbox{ if }i \in A\\
0&\hbox{ if }i \in A
\end{cases}~.
\]

The operators can equally be characterized by their commutation
relations
\[
\partial_{\theta_i} \partial_{\theta_j}=-\partial_{\theta_j} \partial_{\theta_i}
\hbox{ if } 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n
\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad
\partial_{\theta_i}^2 = 0\hbox{ for }1 \leq i \leq n
\]
\[
\partial_{\theta_i} \theta_j=-\theta_j \partial_{\theta_i}
\hbox{ if } 1 \leq i \neq j \leq n
\qquad\hbox{and}\qquad
\partial_{\theta_i} \theta_i = 1\hbox{ for }1 \leq i \leq n~.
\]

For a monomial $\theta_A = \theta_{a_1} \theta_{a_2} \cdots \theta_{a_r}$,
let $\overline{\theta_A} = \theta_{a_r} \theta_{a_{r-1}} \cdots \theta_{a_1}$ represent the
reversing the order of the variables.  Extend this notation to both
differential operators and polynomials (and polynomials on differential operators)
by extending the notation linearly.

We can define an inner product on $R_n$ by setting for $p,q \in R_n$.
\[
\left< p, q \right> = \overline{p(\partial_{\theta_1}, \partial_{\theta_2}, \ldots, \partial_{\theta_n})}
q( \theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n)|_{\theta_1=\theta_2 = \ldots=\theta_n=0}~.
\]
The monomials of $R_n$ form an orthonormal basis of the space with respect to this
inner product.

Define the orthogonal complement to $I_n$ with respect to the inner product as
the set
\[
EQH_n := \left\{ q \in R_n : \left< p, q \right> = 0 \hbox{ for all } p \in I_n \right\}~.
\]
We refer to this space as the \emph{exterior quasisymmetric harmonics}.\footnote{
The harmonics and diagonal harmonics borrows the name from the physics literature
because the harmonic operator $\partial_1^2 + \partial_2^2 + \cdots + \partial_n^2$
is symmetric in the differential operators.  In the case of the exterior algebra,
this operator does not exist and yet we persist by borrowing the name from the
analogous spaces of commuting variables.}

\begin{prop} For all $n \geq 1$, as vector spaces
\[
EQC_n \simeq EQH_n~.
\]\mike{is there a collection of Temperley-Lieb operators for which these spaces are modules and isomorphic?}
\end{prop}
\nantel{We can find a basis of EQC that is closed under Hivert action (without the quotient). Since I don't know anymore what is EQH
I can't tell}

\section{A linear basis of the ideal}

Again let $n$ be a fixed positive integer and $R_n = {\mathbb Q}[\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_n]$.
We have thus far represented the basis for
$R_n$ as the elements $\theta_A$ with $A \subseteq [n]$.  Define $\alpha(A) \in \{ 0,1\}^n$ to be
the sequence $a_1 a_2 a_3 \cdots a_n$ with $a_i = 1$ if $i \in A$ and
$a_i = 0$ if $i \notin A$ so that
\[
\theta_A = \theta_1^{a_1} \theta_2^{a_2} \cdots \theta_n^{a_n} := \theta^{\alpha(A)}~.
\]
For such a sequence $\alpha \in \{0,1\}^n$, let $m_1(\alpha) := \sum_{i=1}^n a_i$
represent the number of $1$s in the string.  This will also be the degree of the monomial
$\theta^{\alpha}$.

To each sequence $\alpha \in \{0, 1\}^n$, we associate a path starting at the origin
and extending into the first quadrant of the $x,y$-plane.  The $i^{th}$ step of this
path will be in the $(1,0)$-direction if $a_i =1$ and it will be in the $(0,1)$-direction
if $a_i = 0$.  We say that the sequence $\alpha$ \defn{crosses the diagonal} if
there is a point on the path which lies at $(a,a)$ and the next step is in the $(0,1)$
direction.  Otherwise we say that $\alpha$ \defn{stays above the diagonal}.  Note that
$\alpha$ stays above the diagonal if $\sum_{i=1}^r a_i \leq \lfloor r/2 \rfloor$ for all $1 \leq r \leq n$
and it crosses the diagonal otherwise.

\begin{example} Let $n=6$ and $\alpha = 010110$ and $\beta = 001100$, then the corresponding
paths are
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75]
  \draw[dotted] (0, 0) grid (4, 4);
  \draw[rounded corners=1, color=black, line width=2] (0, 0) -- (0, 1) -- (1, 1) -- (1, 2) -- (2, 2) -- (3, 2) -- (3, 3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\hskip .5in
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.75]
  \draw[dotted] (0, 0) grid (4, 4);
  \draw[rounded corners=1, color=black, line width=2] (0, 0) -- (0, 1) -- (0, 2) -- (1, 2) -- (2, 2) -- (2, 3) -- (2, 4);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{example}

For sequences $\alpha \in \{ 0, 1 \}^n$, define elements $G_\alpha$ by
\[
G_{1^s0^{n-s}} = F_{1^s}
\]
and if $\alpha \neq 1^s 0^{n-s}$, then $\alpha$ is of the form $u01^s0^{n-k-s}$ for some string $u$
of length $k-1$ and we recursively define
\[
G_{u01^s0^{n-k-s}} = G_{u1^s0^{n-k-s+1}} - (-1)^{m_1(u)} \theta_k G_{u1^{s-1}0^{n-k-s+2}}~.
\]
\mike{What is the origin of this set of elements?  Can we point to places in the literature?
Is it based on the other bases for quotient rings and is it clear how there is a modification
for the fact that we are working in the exterior algebra e.g. that
sign is there because the $\theta_k$ is being multiplied on the left of the polynomial.
Could we equally move it off to the right and introduce a sign of $(-1)^{s-1}$?}
\nantel{the origin from Aval-Bergeron paper where we selected a subset of the $S$-polynomials
to understand them all (all other S-polynomial are written in term of those. The exact definition
here is no a direct translation of the commutative case, but well adapted for the exterior case.}

\begin{example} For $\alpha = 010110$ and $\beta = 001100$, we compute
the elements $G_\alpha$ and $G_\beta$ using the definition.
\begin{align*}
G_{010110} &= G_{011100} + \theta_3 G_{011000} = (G_{111000} - \theta_1 G_{110000})
+ \theta_3(G_{110000} - \theta_1 G_{100000})\\
&= \theta_2 \theta_4 \theta_5 + \theta_2 \theta_4 \theta_6 + \theta_2 \theta_5 \theta_6
+ 2 \theta_3 \theta_4 \theta_5 + 2 \theta_3 \theta_4 \theta_6 + 2 \theta_3 \theta_5 \theta_6
+ \theta_4 \theta_5 \theta_6
\end{align*}

and we have that
\begin{align*}
G_{001100} &= G_{011000} - \theta_2 G_{010000} = (G_{110000} - \theta_1 G_{100000})
- \theta_2 (G_{100000} - \theta_1 G_{000000})\\
&= \theta_3 \theta_4 + \theta_3 \theta_5 + \theta_3 \theta_6 + \theta_4 \theta_5 + \theta_4 \theta_6 + \theta_5 \theta_6
\end{align*}
\end{example}

Order the monomials of $R_n$ so that we say $\theta_A < \theta_B$ if
$\alpha(A)$ is smaller than $\alpha(B)$ in lexicographic order.
An important property of these elements is the following statement.

\begin{lemma}
The leading term of $G_\alpha$ is $\theta^\alpha$.
\end{lemma}

These elements $G_\alpha$ are defined so that we could use them to
identify a nice basis of the ideal $I_n$.

\begin{theorem}
If $\alpha$ crosses the diagonal, then $G_\alpha \in I_n$.
\end{theorem}
