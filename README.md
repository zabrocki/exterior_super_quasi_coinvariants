    [Make sure the push happen, there are 3 know problems
        (a) the server does not respond and the push stall,
        (b) there are conflict, but automerge solve them for you, the command "git commit -a" is done for you

            Go in your file and resolves the conflicts

    git push (AGAIN)]
